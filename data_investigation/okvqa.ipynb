    "With 19 different average answer lengths, we obseve that the average answer length is in general quite low. It is observable from the percentage dataframe, that around 92% of the answers (including variability) consists of single words. There are however questions, that have an average answer length of 7.2. With this distribution of average answer lengths that follows a power law, it seems like the questions are rather simple as most of them are answerable with a single word. This, however, could also be due to an experimental bias, where answers given by the human annotators, have been pruned to their essential parts - either while doing the collection or as a post-processing such that determiner words are removed to solely keep the important content of the answers. In other words - the human annotators might have been told to keep their answers short and to the point, in order to not need a text generation module creating long sequences with SOTA performances to answer the questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll get back to the outliers (long answers) later... Let's first dig into the fact that the responses on a question might differ. We call this the answer variability and compute the number of different answers for each question as another metric for understanding question complexity."
